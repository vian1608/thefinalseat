# SEO and Google Indexing

The site includes a technical SEO layer designed to give search engines consistent crawl and indexing signals.

## Canonical Domain

All public SEO URLs use:

```text
https://www.thefinalseat.com
```

Non-canonical host variants are redirected to the canonical `www` host.

## Sitemap

The sitemap is stored at:

```text
frontend/public/sitemap.xml
```

Production URL:

```text
https://www.thefinalseat.com/sitemap.xml
```

Only public canonical pages intended for search indexing should be added to the sitemap.

## Robots.txt

Robots rules are stored at:

```text
frontend/public/robots.txt
```

Production URL:

```text
https://www.thefinalseat.com/robots.txt
```

## Metadata

Public landing pages use page-specific metadata where applicable, including:

- `<title>`
- Meta description
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph metadata
- Twitter metadata
- Robots directives
- Structured data / JSON-LD

The homepage includes structured data describing The Final Seat as a travel-related business and website.

---

## Pages That Should Not Be Indexed

Transactional, account, customer-specific, and administrative pages are intentionally excluded from normal search indexing.

Examples include:

```text
/admin/*
/search
/payment
/booking
/authorize/*
/confirmation/*
/booking-confirmed/*
/my-bookings
/signin
/signup
/return-flight
/car-rentals/search
/car-rentals/results
```

These pages should **not** be added to `sitemap.xml`.

---

# Google Search Console

For Google indexing, the sitemap should be submitted in Google Search Console:

```text
https://www.thefinalseat.com/sitemap.xml
```

Recommended priority URLs for manual URL Inspection / Request Indexing:

```text
https://www.thefinalseat.com/
https://www.thefinalseat.com/travel-assistance
https://www.thefinalseat.com/senior-travel/flight-deals
https://www.thefinalseat.com/urgent-travel
https://www.thefinalseat.com/booking-for-parents
```

Google determines whether and when a page is indexed. A sitemap improves URL discovery but does not guarantee rankings or indexing.

---

# Local Development

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend development server uses the backend proxy configured in `frontend/package.json`.

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Required production credentials and service configuration should be provided through environment variables. Do not commit private credentials or API keys to the repository.

---

# Testing

Run the backend production-readiness test suite with:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

or:

```bash
npm run verify:production-ready
```

The test suite includes checks for:

- Pre-production safety
- Google Ads lead conversion
- Admin booking workflow
- Admin dashboard button reliability
- Inquiry persistence
- SEO and indexing contracts

Build the frontend with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

# Updating the Sitemap

When adding a new public SEO page:

1. Create the route and page content.
2. Give the page a unique title and meta description.
3. Add a self-referencing canonical URL.
4. Make sure the page is allowed to be indexed.
5. Add the canonical URL to `frontend/public/sitemap.xml`.
6. Update the `<lastmod>` value when the page receives a meaningful content update.
7. Run the production-readiness tests.
8. Deploy the site.
9. Request indexing in Google Search Console when appropriate.

Do **not** add admin, payment, authorization, search-result, account, or other private/transaction-specific URLs to the sitemap.
