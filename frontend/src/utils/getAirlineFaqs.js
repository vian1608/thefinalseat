      question: `${airlineName} change policy`,
      answer: `Change fees and fare differences depend on your ticket type. Restricted fares may charge penalties or forbid changes; flexible fares often allow changes before departure with only a fare difference. Our team can help you understand options for your itinerary.`,

      question: `${airlineName} cancellation policy`,
      answer: `Refundable fares may return to your original payment method. Non-refundable fares usually become travel credit minus any cancellation fee. Cancel before departure—no-shows on restricted tickets often forfeit all value.`,

      question: `Refunds, credits, and timing for ${airlineName}`,
      answer: `Many carriers allow a short post-purchase cancellation window on eligible fares. Airline schedule changes may open refund rights separate from standard cancel rules. We can help interpret your ticket category.`,
